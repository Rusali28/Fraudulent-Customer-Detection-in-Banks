# Fraudulent-Customer-Detection-in-Banks

On the basis of data obtained from a bank, we consider customers who have taken loans from the bank and use Artificial Neural Networks to predict whether the customer is likely to repay the loan back to the bank, hence helping the bank avoid fraudulent transactions. 
We also try to improve on the performance of the ANN using GridSearchCV.
